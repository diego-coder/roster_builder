# roster_builder

Takes a data file of players with attack and defense stats, implements a bubble sort to place the top attackers and defenders into ArrayLists and gives several options: show the best 3 attackers, best three defenders, or build even teams of 6 out of up 25 players total.  

For example, a roster with 12 players on it would be divided up into two scrimmage teams, and three of the top six attackers would be assigned to each of the two scrimmage teams. After the top attackers have been assigned to make up half of each scrimmage team, then the top blockers (from the remaining unassigned players) would similarly be assigned (three to each scrimmage team in this example) to make up the other half of each team.
